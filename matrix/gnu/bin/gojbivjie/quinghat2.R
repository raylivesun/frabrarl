# 1.  **Identify the Core Components:**
# Break the expression down into its main
# parts separated by the `+` operator
# *   Part 1: `cosh(x+y)/sqrt(x+y)`
# *   Part 2: `O((x+y^z)+sinh(x+y))`
s2 <-function(d1, d2, d3) {
   if (d1 == cosh(d1)){
       print(d1^4)

     return (d1)
   }

       print(d2^4)

     return (d2)

# * Numerator: `cosh(x+y)` - This is the hyperbolic cosine function
# applied to the sum `x + y`. It's a standard mathematical function.
x <-c(h1 = 4, h2 = 2, h3 = 3)
y <-c(h1 = 4, h2 = 2, h3 = 3)
z <-c(h1 = 4, h2 = 2, h3 = 3)

s3 <- cosh(x+y)
    
# *   Denominator: `sqrt(x+y)` - This is the square root function 
# applied to the sum `x + y`.                                       
s4 <- sqrt(x+y)+sum(x+y)

# *   Constraint: For the square root to be defined (in real numbers),
# the argument `(x + y)` must be non-negative (`x + y >= 0`). For the
# division to be defined, the denominator cannot be zero, so `sqrt(x+y)`
# cannot be zero, which means `x + y` must be strictly greater than zero 
# (`x + y > 0`).

s5 <- c(x + y)+sum(x + y >= 0)+sqrt(x + y)+ t(x + y)+sum(x + y > 0)

                                                            
# *   Overall: This part represents a specific numerical value determined
# by the values of `x` and `y`, provided `x + y > 0`.
s6 <- c(x + y)+sum(x + y > 0)

# 3. **Analyze Part 2: `O((x+y^z)+sinh(x+y))`**
#    *   Recognize the notation: `O(...)` signifies "Big O notation".
#    *   Recall the meaning of Big O: It describes the *limiting behavior*
# or *order of magnitude* of a function or, more commonly in this context,
# the *error term* or *remainder* in an approximation (like a series expansion).
# It indicates that the terms *not explicitly shown* are bounded above by a
# constant multiple of the function inside the `O()` as some variable
# approaches a specific limit (often 0 or infinity).
alp2 <- c(( x + y ^ z )+sinh( x + y ))
view <- show(list(alp2))
often <- alp2 - 15

# *   Analyze the function inside the Big O: `(x + y^z) + sinh(x+y)`
#     *   `x`: Simple variable.
#     *   `y^z`: Variable `y` raised to the power of variable `z`.
#     *    Standard exponentiation.
#     *   `sinh(x+y)`: Hyperbolic sine of `x + y`. Standard mathematical
#     *    function.
#     *   The expression `(x + y^z) + sinh(x+y)` itself defines the *rate
#     *  of growth* or *magnitude* that the hidden terms do *not exceed*.
s7  <- c( x + y ^ z ) + sinh( x + y ) + t( x + y ^ z ) + sinh( x + y ) +
       c( x + y ^ z ) + sinh( x + y )

# 3.  **Analyze Part 2: `O((x+y^z)+sinh(x+y))`**
#    *   Recognize the notation: `O(...)` signifies "Big O notation".
#    *   Recall the meaning of Big O: It describes the *limiting behavior*
# or *order of magnitude* of a function or, more commonly in this context,
# the *error term* or *remainder* in an approximation
# (like a series expansion). It indicates that the terms *not explicitly
# shown* are bounded above by a constant multiple of the function inside
# the `O()` as some variable approaches a specific limit
# (often 0 or infinity).
anpl <- c(( x + y ^ z) + sinh ( x + y ))

# 4.  **Synthesize the Meaning:**
#    *   The expression combines a precise mathematical term
# (`cosh(x+y)/sqrt(x+y)`) with an asymptotic term (`O(...)`).
#    *   This structure strongly suggests the expression likely resulted from
# some form of approximation, where `cosh(x+y)/sqrt(x+y)` is the leading term
# (or terms), and `O(...)` represents the magnitude of the terms that were
# dropped or ignored in the approximation.
#    *   The complete expression isn't something you'd typically "calculate"
# in the sense of getting a single number, because the `O(...)` part represents
# a *bound* on error, not a specific value.
synt <- cosh( x + y ) / sqrt( x + y )

# 5.  **Consider Computational Implementation:**
#    *   If asked to compute the "value" of this expression in a programming
# context (like R or Python), you would almost certainly only compute the
# *non-Big O* part: `cosh(x+y) / sqrt(x+y)`.
#    *   You would need defined values for `x` and `y` (and potentially `z
# if you were analyzing the *bound* itself, but not for the main term).
#    *   Remember the domain constraint: `x + y > 0`. The computation
# would fail or return `NaN`/`Inf` if this isn't met.
part <- cosh( x + y ) / sqrt ( x + y)
domain <- x + y > 0

# 6.  **Formulate the Explanation:**
#    *   Start by breaking down the expression into its two main additive parts.
#    *   Explain the first part: `cosh(x+y)/sqrt(x+y)`. Define the functions
# (`cosh`, `sqrt`) and note the domain constraint (`x + y > 0`). State that
# this part is numerically commutable.
#    *   Explain the second part: `O((x+y^z)+sinh(x+y))`. Define Big O notation
# clearly. Explain that it represents the order of magnitude of neglected
# terms/error. Emphasize that it's not a specific numerical value to be added.
# Explain the function *inside* the Big O describes the *rate*
# of growth/magnitude.
#    *   Combine the explanations: The overall expression represents a specific
# value plus terms that are asymptotically bounded by the function
# within the `O()`.
#    *   Provide code examples (R, Python) for computing the *numerically
# defined* part, explicitly stating that the Big O term is omitted from direct
# calculation. Include comments about the domain constraint.
